# Inventory search project.
A python program that allows users to create an inventory and add products and their prices. It then allows users to search the inventory for a particular product and returns the price. You can keep on adding products and search for prices until you ask the program to stop. Several products can be added!

*Based on **Dictionary** made on python.*

This program is also a solution to the question provided on "Cs with python" book by Sumita Arora for class 11.
